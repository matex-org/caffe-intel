Instructions for Fault Tolerance:

- Use branch feature/ft_frozen.
- Install ULFM-OpenMPI and made available on PATH
- Enable FILE-IO by executing {for file in ompi/mpi/c/file_*.c; do sed -i
  's/OPAL_ENABLE_FT_MPI/0 \&\& OPAL_ENABLE_FT_MPI/g' $file; done}
- Avoid enabling thread-multiple flag for ULFM.
  on the ULFM_OpenMPI SRC/ROOT/Folder.
- Compile Caffe dependencies that require MPI with ULFM
- Enable Fault tolerance with "CAFFE_FT := 1" in CAFFE_SRC_ROOT/Makefile.config

Execution:

- Execute caffe with "-am enable-ft-mpi" just before the application.
